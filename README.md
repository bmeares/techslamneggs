# Tech Slam 'N Eggs

This repository contains the code for my May 3, 2023 workshop at Greenville's Tech Slam 'N Eggs!

## WORK IN PROGRESS

You may see this code continue to grow and evolve until the May 3, 2023 workshop. Since it's a demonstration project, I'll be a little messier than usual since it's we're deploying this (yet ðŸ¤«).
